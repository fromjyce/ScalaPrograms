# Scala Programs
This repository contains the Scala programs that I have been working on since attending a bootcamp as part of a scholarship program. These programs cover a range of topics, including fundamental concepts, control structures, collections, functions, and file handling. They reflect my learning and progress in Scala during the bootcamp.

## Structure of the Repository

## Running the Programs
These programs have been tested on Linux

To run a scala program, navigate to the folder containing the program and run the following command:
```
scala programname.scala
```
