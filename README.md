# Scala Programs
This repository contains the Scala programs that I have been working on since attending a bootcamp as part of a scholarship program. These programs cover a range of topics, including fundamental concepts, control structures, collections, functions, and file handling. They reflect my learning and progress in Scala during the bootcamp.
